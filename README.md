From wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)#Backtracking

> Other applications of backtracking involve searching through spaces that represent potential solutions to an optimization problem. Branch and bound is a technique for performing such backtracking searches without exhaustively searching all of the potential solutions in such a space.
